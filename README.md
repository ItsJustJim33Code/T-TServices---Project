## Description

This website is to allow customers to more easily obtain information such as opening times, contact information and location along with being able to book services and contact
the business from one central website. This website also directs customers to the business' facebook page and also has useful links to access various information and services
for any car owner - this will help user traffic as people will still use the website to access these "useful links" even if they do not need a specific service from T&T Vehicle Center.

the features within this website include;

- Landing page

  - `Header` - Header contains the logo of the company along with the navbar and a matching colour pallete to extend the whole screen.

  - `Navigation` - A navigation bar at the top of the page within the header that shows the other available pages and which page is currently the `active` page. when a navigation page is highlight / hovered over it will become bolder to show the user it is a clickable link. On mobile the navigation bar is hidden within a burger icon and when pressed expands out to show the available pages along with an indicator to show which page is the currently active page.

  - `About Section` - Information about the company, overview of the services we provide and history of the company.

  - `Booking Services` - Allows the user to book a service depending on their needs via the individual booking forms, the forms allow the user to fill out details about themselves and a clear input for car registration which allows the business to get all the car information they would need for the booking.

  - `Footer` - footer contains `Facebook` link and two other links that take them to `Contact-Us` page for `Useful Links` and `Contact us` form. The reason this is in the footer is so the user easily identify how to directly contact the business without navigating and website for too long and if the user is just looking for useful links to use this is also easily accessible with minamal navigation.

  ## Planned updates / Challenges

  - Planned changes
    - Booking forms to include calendar information to book a date and time
    - Booking forms and contact forms to go to an email address and have an auto reply back to let the user know it was successful.
    - review section directly lifted from the companies Facebook page (will require javascript)

- Challenges
  - Had some issues with the flexboxes
  - Had some issues with displaying the website in landscape on some mobile device sizes
  - Had some issues with flexboxes when the website was deployed on live pages compared to when using developer tools
  - Had issues with the useful links section links when in desktop view and the boxes when hovered over due to the .css rules would the elements next to it. This happened with the footer elements when hovered over, This issue is due to the font size getting bigger when hovered over which moves the other elements but i couldnt figure out how to do something similar without changing font size and not moving other elements when interacted.

## Testing

- I have confirmed the webpage is reponsive on multiple browsers; Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- I have tested the project is responsive on multiple screen sizes and devices and works on different orientations using the devtools device toolbar and live pages.
- i have confirmed with user testing that the main features of the page are visble, readable and easy to follow with current website pallete, font sizes and interaction.
- i have confirmed all forms within the webpage function correctly and post when clicking the submit button.

## Validator Testing

- HTML Validator
  - No issues found
- CSS3 Validator
  - 1 issue present due to using external stylesheet i.e Google Fonts

## Bugs / Issues

- Current bugs / issues
  - Header extends past the width of the page (However changing this currently makes the burger icon and navigation menu appear off screen)
  - between `471px` and `768px` on mobile the background image on contact us page extends full width of the screen and the flex boxes extend outside of the background image.
